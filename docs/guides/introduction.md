## What is FITS?

The File Information Tool Set (FITS) identifies, validates and extracts technical metadata for a wide range of file formats. It acts as a wrapper, invoking and managing the output from several other open source tools. Output from these tools are converted into a common format, compared to one another and consolidated into a single XML output file. FITS is written in Java and is compatible with Java 1.8 or higher. The external tools currently used are:

- [Apache](http://tika.apache.org/)
- [Jhove](https://github.com/openpreserve/jhove)
- [MediaInfo](https://mediaarea.net/en/MediaInfo)
- [Exiftool](http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/)
- [National Library of New Zealand Metadata Extractor](http://meta-extractor.sourceforge.net/)
- [DROID](https://github.com/digital-preservation/droid)
- [FFIdent](http://schmidt.devlib.org/ffident/index.html)
- [File Utility (windows)](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/)
