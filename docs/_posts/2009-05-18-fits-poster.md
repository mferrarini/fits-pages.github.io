Harvard is in the process of integrating the [MediaInfo](https://mediaarea.net/en/MediaInfo) tool into FITS! When complete, the tool will provide format identification and technical metadata extraction for video file formats, allow FITS XML to represent technical metadata for video file formats, and support the creation of [EBUCore](https://tech.ebu.ch/MetadataEbuCore) XML metadata through the use of the embedded OTS package.

It is expected that the first public release will be made in summer 2016, in support of a Harvard project to add video preservation and access services to the Harvard Digital Repository Service, a project that has been made possible through the generous support of the Arcadia Fund.

MediaInfo and EBUCore were selected for video format analysis and technical metadata delivery in consultation with [AVPreserve](http://www.avpreserve.com/).
